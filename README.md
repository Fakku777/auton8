Chat mention replies
Better logging
hud module cut off / cleanup 
Refine setting a goal
Desync issue with goal and hud

some of the baritone router things are spammed
(^ asked chat but did not add to code yet ^)


















Collect certain things from chat into discord log

chatbot feedback loop, gpt plays 2b2t

Gather food, Gather wood, gather stone, gather diamonds
get at least 50k blocks out of spawn, visit multiple dimensions 
Interact with chat







Your goal is to escape spawn, so at least 20k blocks out
You should gather a few things along the way, dirt for building
oak, stone, iron, smelt, craft, gather diamonds, craft - gear up (auto armor)

use search to know when wanted items are in range to avoid nothing found at start / 00

auto eat, starts with food

If run into player, pause - message user "Hey what's up" and if they reply - 
build an appropriate reply then politely asking for items


if player leaves render continue, if die then restart
If gets stuck run restart /kill

rather than a single go to (out of spawn) no one command should be 
more than 1k blocks in distance to keep things interesting.
the idea is pgt chains things together and for a demonstration a single go to
command is not impressive 



if disconnect wait till reconcect

if player stop movement message player (ask gpt)

if player leaves render continue with goal 
if stuck restart /kill

If die, restart
once at goal send discord webhook message









Chat logs, baritone logs
life status, position, inventory, current dimension


GPT chatbot
Database connection

Send chat messages from discord


Collect chat from 2b2t for x time, and train an ai on that data


If player enters range, then do X


could a local mod forge instructions and get a user to essentially grief their own base?
